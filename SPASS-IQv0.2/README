=========================== GMP vs. FLINT ===========================
=====================================================================

This folder contains two versions of SPASS-IQ that use different
libraries for precise arithmetic. One is based on GMP
(https://gmplib.org/) the other is based on FLINT
(http://www.flintlib.org/). The FLINT version is slightly faster, but
the FLINT library is only locally linked (because of the size of the
FLINT library). To use the FLINT version, FLINT has to be locally
installed and the library has to be added/linked to a folder that is
searched for shared libraries. If you do not want to add FLINT
permanently to the shared libraries, then you can also temporarily
share it via the command:

LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:YOUR_LOCAL_PATH_TO_THE_FLINT_INSTALLATION

=====================================================================

SPASSIQ [Options] [Inputfile]

Options:

-h or --help
print this help

-v or --verbose
print
  - 0: only sat/unsat (default)
  - 1: intermediate search statistics
  - 2: additional steps

-t or --time
print detailed timing information

-S or --statistics
print LA-statistics

-V or --version
show version and exit

-m or --print-model
print a model if the clause set is satisfiable

-o or --check-model
check the model with respect to the clause set if it is satisfiable

-B or --bounding_transformations
LI(R)A: the branch-and-bound solver applies bounding transformations on partially unbounded problems.
  - 0: off
  - 1: on (default)

-T or --print_bounding_transformations
LI(R)A: the branch-and-bound solver returns the transformed system in SMT-LIB2 format whenever it applies the bounding transformations.
